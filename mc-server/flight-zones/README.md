# Flight Zones

Script made by: Jean majid

I coded this for a person once but he never used it so I decided to translate it to english and release it to the public.
Its nothing special and not really good but it doesn't use much performance and it works.

## Description

This script allows you to create zones in which players can fly.
It only works if the players have tag fly but and also the interval is extremly slow to save performance.
It will maybe sometimes destroy your fly in creative so if you can't fly in creative run /ability @s mayfly true

Available commands:

- !flyhelp: Displays a list of available commands you can use.
- !flypos1: Sets the first corner of your flight zone to your current location.
- !flypos2: Sets the second corner of your flight zone to your current location. The flight zone will be a   rectangle defined by these two corners.
- !flyzone (name): Creates a flight zone with the name you specify. The zone will be defined by the positions you set with !flypos1 and !flypos2.
- !flydelete (name): Deletes the flight zone with the name you specify.
- !flyshowall: Shows all existing flight zones.
